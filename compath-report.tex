\abstract

In a multihop ad hoc network, the interference among nodes is
reduced to maximize the throughput by using a smallest transmission
range that still preserve the network connectivity. However, most
existing works on transmission range control focus on the
connectivity but lack of results on the throughput performance. This
paper analyzes the per-node saturated throughput of an IEEE 802.11b
multihop ad hoc network with a uniform transmission range. Compared
to simulation, our model can accurately predict the per-node
throughput.  The results show that the maximum achievable per-node
throughput can be as low as 11\% of the channel capacity in a normal
set of $\alpha$ operating parameters independent of node density. However, if
the network connectivity is considered, the obtainable throughput
will reduce by as many as 43\% of the maximum throughput.

This appendix describes two static allocation methods for fGn (or fBm)
traffic. Here, $\lambda$ and $C$ are respectively the traffic arrival
rate and the service rate per dimensionless time step. Their unit are
converted to a physical time unit by multiplying the step size
$\Delta$. For a fBm self-similar traffic source,
Norros~\cite{norros95} provides its EB as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norros}
    C = \lambda + (\kappa(H)\sqrt{-2\ln\epsilon})^{1/H}a^{1/(2H)}x^{-(1-H)/H}\lambda^{1/(2H)}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa(H) = H^H(1-H)^{(1-H)}$. Simplicity in the calculation is
the attractive feature of (\ref{eq:norros}).

The MVA technique developed in~\cite{kim01} so far provides the most
accurate estimation of the loss probability compared to previous
bandwidth allocation techniques according to simulation results.
Consider a discrete-time queueing system with constant service rate
$C$ and input process $\lambda_n$ with $\mathbb{E}\{\lambda_n\} =
    \lambda$ and $\mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\} = \sigma^2$.  Define $X_n \equiv
    \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k - Cn$.  The loss probability due to the MVA
approach is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss_mva}
    \varepsilon \approx \alpha e^{-m_x/2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mx}
    m_x = \min_{n \geq 0} \frac{((C-\lambda)n + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}} =
    \frac{((C-\lambda)n^\ast + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_{n^{\ast}}\}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha}
    \alpha =
    \frac{1}{\lambda\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(\frac{(C-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
    \int_C^\infty (r-C)\exp\left(\frac{(r-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\, dr
\end{equation}
For a given $\varepsilon$, we numerically solve for $C$ that satisfies
(\ref{eq:loss_mva}). Any search algorithm can be used to do the task.
Here, the bisection method is used.

Next, we show how $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ can be determined.  Let
$C_{\lambda}(l)$ be the autocovariance function of $\lambda_n$.  The
MVA technique basically approximates the input process $\lambda_n$
with a Gaussian process, which allows $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ to be
represented by the autocovariance function.  In particular, the
variance of $X_n$ can be expressed in terms of $C_{\lambda}(l)$ as
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Var}\{X_n\} = nC_{\lambda}(0) + 2\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (n-l)C_{\lambda}(l)
\end{equation}
Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
by assuming specific traffic models or by off-line analysis in case of
traces.  In most practical situations, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ will not be
known in advance, and an on-line measurement algorithm developed
in~\cite{eun01} is required to jointly determine both $n^\ast$ and
$m_x$. For fGn traffic, $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ is equal to $\sigma^2
    n^{2H}$, where $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\}$, and we can find
the $n^\ast$ that minimizes (\ref{eq:mx}) directly. Although $\lambda$
can be easily measured, it is not the case for $\sigma^2$ and $H$.
Consequently, the MVA technique suffers from the need of prior
knowledge traffic parameters.
